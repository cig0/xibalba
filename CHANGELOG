 0.5.2 - 26/Jun/2014
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - We (finally!) created a README.md file.
 - We (finally!) migrated the code and the source files from a 
   self-hosted server repo at RedHat OpenShift, to GitHub (yay!)
 - Changed Xibalba's directory structure (added /images).
 - Changed the [-V, --changelog] layout.
 - Added 'less' dep.
 - Removed 'cat' dep.
 - Moved from GPLv2 to GPLv3 (References and 'LICENSE' file).
 - Improved quiet connection and reconnection (no more non 
   human-friendly log system at standard output when reconnecting to the
   VPN!).
 - Very important bugfix: when using Xibalba while no connected to a
   VPN, the startup connection never happens (only works when you're not
   using the Internet Kill Switch [-k, --killswitch]).
 - Changed the 'CHANGELOG' file layout.
 - Added information about the 2 operational modes in [-h, --help] and 
   the README.md file.
 - Added raw 'VERSION' file to github (and removed the old version.txt
   from RedHat OpenShift host.
 - Add donation information to README.md
 - Removed the usage of md5sum.txt (@ xibalba.py). Now github generates
   the .zip bundles automatically :)
 - Replaced the old self-hosted bundle (at RedHat OpenShift) named 
   latest.tar.bz2 for a brand new master.zip generated automatically by 
   github archive.
 - Added donation info to the manpage.

 0.5.1 - 25/Jun/2014
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - Added some alerts for those python3 users who don't have python2 
   installed.
 - Support for VPNs configured with whitespaces in it's name/label.
 - Added some documentation about [-c, --connection] param.
 - Check all deps at startup (and alert if some of them are not found).
 - Improved exception manage and handle. Now Xibalba handle ALL kind of

   them).
 - Added some alerts for those gtk3 users who don't have gtk2 libs 
   installed.
 - Handle some GeoIP errors when the user IP is not assigned to any

   the country tag.
 - Implemented GPLv2 License to Xibalba.
 - Added GPLv2 license file.

 - Removed the [-o, --oldhelp] param. This param was only used for 
   testing.
