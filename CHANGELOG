------------------------------------------------------------------------
 0.5.2 - 26/Jun/2014
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - Changed Xibalba's directory structure (added /images).
 - Changed the [-V, --changelog] layout.
 - Added 'less' dep.
 - Removed 'cat' dep.
 - Moved from GPLv2 to GPLv3 (References and 'LICENSE' file).
 - Improved quiet connection and reconnection (no more non 
   human-friendly log system at standard output when reconnecting to the
   VPN!).
 - Very important bugfix: when using Xibalba while no connected to a
   VPN, the startup connection never happens (only works when you're not

   testing.
