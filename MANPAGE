.SH "NAME"
Xibalba \(em VPN monitor tool and Internet Kill Switch
.SH "MODES"
.IP "\fB""Reconnection"" mode:\fP"
If Xibalba detects that your VPN is down, it alert the user and tries to restore the VPN connection automatically
.br
This is Xibalba's default behaviour (no extra flag needed)
.IP "\fB""Internet Kill Switch"" mode:\fP"
If Xibalba detects that your VPN is down, it automatically alert the user and shut down all the network trafic by applying some iptables rules, dropping all INPUT, FORWARD and OUTPUT packages
.br
If using this mode you're really secure, and if your VPN goes down there is no way your IP get leaked
.br
If you want to run Xibalba with the Kill Switch feature, you have tu use [\fB-k\fP, \fB--killswitch\fP] param

.SH "CONSIDERATIONS"
.PP
If you are running this script while your VPN \fIis active\fP and connected: You should use only [\fB-c\fP, \fB--connection\fP] parameter ([\fB-u\fP, \fB--uuid\fP] is also welcome, but not mandatory)
.PP
If you are running this script while your VPN \fIis not active\fP: You should use [\fB-c\fP, \fB--connection\fP] and [\fB-u\fP, \fB--uuid\fP] parameters (both are mandatory)
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IP "\fB-u\fP \fISTRING\fP, \fB--uuid=\fP\fISTRING\fP"
Set the VPN uuid
.br
(you can get your VPN uuid running '$ nmcli con status' in your shell while connected to the VPN -no root required-)

.IP "\fB-c\fP \fISTRING\fP, \fB--connection=\fP\fISTRING\fP"
Set the VPN name/label
.br
If the connection name/label has more than one word, you should put it between double quotation marks (" ")
.br
REMINDER: This param is case sensitive!
.br
(you can check your VPN name/label running '$ nmcli con status' in your shell while connected to the VPN  -no root required-)

.IP "\fB-l\fP \fISTRING\fP, \fB--logfile=\fP\fISTRING\fP"
Set the full path of the logfile where Xibalba will write the output
.br
The user running Xibalba needs read and write rights in this path
.br
By default, logs are being saved in /tmp/xibalba.log

.IP "\fB-t\fP \fIVALUE\fP, \fB--timeloop=\fP\fIVALUE\fP"
Set the time (in seconds) that Xibalba will use to cycle between each VPN status check
.br
Default value: 30

.IP "\fB-k\fP, \fB--killswitch\fP"
Enable the 'Internet Kill Switch' mode.
.br
When running with this flag set and a VPN disconnection happens, instead of trying to reconnect to the VPN, Xibalba automatically shut down ALL the network traffic
.br
The Kill Switch mode prevents the user to continue browsing the internet when the VPN disconnects, by doing this it prevents the user not notifying when the VPN is down
.br
This mode is recommended for those more paranoid, and other people interested in avoiding leaks while browsing the internet protected with a VPN
.br
In order to browse the internet again after this switch gets activated, you have to run Xibalba with [\fB-r\fP, \fB--restorenetwork\fP] flag
.br
You need to be root to run Xibalba with the Kill Switch mode (It needs to upgrade your iptables rules)

.IP "\fB-r\fP, \fB--restorenetwork\fP"
Restore your internet browsing. You have to do this when you wanna use your internet connection normally after the Internet Kill Switch gets activated.
.br
You need to be root to run Xibalba with the Restore mode (It needs to upgrade your iptables rules)
